## Usage

This app is ready to go and built in a data-driven manner. Simply edit the JSON object in `src/Utils/Constants.js` to contain your tokens and the amounts you own of each. You should also find images for each of your tokens otherwise it will default to Dogecoin. 

You can then push the app out to your own Expo account to use it on your phone.
